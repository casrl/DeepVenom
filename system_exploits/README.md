A set of tools and utility for mounting the tensor weight side channels and rowhammer attacks is included here


### Compile attacker and victim programs
- First compile attacker program by navigating "attacker" directory and running "make".
- Then compile victim program by naviagting "victim" directory and running "./setup.sh build"

### Run the exploit
- First run the attack by running "taskset 0x1 ./main <path_of_pytorch_library> <path_of_bitflip_profile> &" from the "attacker" directory.
- Then run the victim program by running "./setup.sh run" from the "victim" directory.

Attacker will populate the "output.dat" with addresses for hammering to introduce bitflip in victim model at appropriate iterations.
